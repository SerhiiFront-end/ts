				From running educational courses on business and employment to
				tending our allotment and planting trees in the neighbourhood,
				there are lots of ways in which we can enrich the lives of those
				we help. Improving social, language and digital skills is key to
				the personal development we aim to provide.
			</p>
			<p className='mt-5'>
				For people on low incomes and those in vulnerable situations,
				one of the biggest barriers to moving forward in their lives is
				a lack of confidence. We help to build this through the
				activities we run. Often all it takes is a simple connection
				with others in the community.
			</p>
			<p className='mt-5'>
				We know that when people facing challenges believe in themselves
				and develop certain key skills, they are able to make huge steps
				forward. That's why we started providing support to people with
				mental health issues in 2017.{" "}
