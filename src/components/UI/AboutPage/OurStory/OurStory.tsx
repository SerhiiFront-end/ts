			<p className='mt-5'>
				Cosmo Community CIC helps disadvantaged people across Hull to
				develop skills, self-confidence and more through coaching and
				social enterprise projects. This includes people with poor
				mental health as well as those who have emigrated here and are
				held back by language or cultural barriers.
			</p>
			<p className='mt-5'>
				The project was set up by Altynay and four more volunteers in
				2013 after working closely with immigrants who had become
				disadvantaged as a result of socio-economic barriers in their
				way. Her own experience of moving to the UK gave her first-hand
				experience of the problems faced and inspired her to form
				Cosmoâ€™s vision.
			</p>
			<p className='mt-5'>
				Since 2013 we have continued to grow and have been successful in
				applying in a number of grants to further our vision.
